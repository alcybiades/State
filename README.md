# State
Pedagogical exercise to construct the foundations of math (arithmetic) from nothing more than a basic notion of encapsulation (i.e. a Python class which can either hold nothing or just one object which is itself of the same class). No loops, no numbers, no foundational types except for `State`. If statements are used, but only to discern whether something is `None`.
